# Rift for Astro

An Astro theme built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. We couldn't come up with a catchy tagline.

## Building

1. Clone this repo. Usually with `git clone https://github.com/njs-guy/rift-astro.git`.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
4. Run `yarn build` to export the site and run `yarn preview` to test the build.

## Roadmap

Still under development. Nothing is final yet, obviously.
