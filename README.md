# Rift for Astro

An Astro theme built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. We couldn't come up with a catchy tagline.

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 (current)

Still under development. Nothing is final yet, obviously.

### v0.8.0

Mostly feature complete for 1.0 but missing content.

Fully feature complete for 1.0 but missing documentation.
